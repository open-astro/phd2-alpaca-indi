// Implementation is intentionally a stub at this stage. The full INDIGO
// camera client (Connect/Capture/cooling/binning/ROI/gain, BLOB transfer,
// property state machine) lands in a follow-up commit once the shared
// indigo_client_base wrapper is in place. Returning nullptr here keeps the
// translation unit link-clean so the registry can advertise INDIGO_CAMERA
// while the dispatch path is still being wired up.
