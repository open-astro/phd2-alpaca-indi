# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenAstro PHD2 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `debian/control` now ships a `phd2-alpaca` transitional metadata package alongside `openastro-phd2`. It is `Architecture: all`, owns no files, and depends on `openastro-phd2 (= ${binary:Version})`. Existing `phd2-alpaca` users who run an apt-managed upgrade now get pulled into `openastro-phd2` automatically without first having to `apt remove phd2-alpaca`; `build-deb.sh` produces a `phd2-alpaca-<version>-all.deb` next to the main `openastro-phd2-<version>-<arch>.deb`. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.

### Fixed
- `debian/openastro-phd2.postrm` now removes `/var/lib/openastro-phd2` on package purge. The postinst creates this directory for runtime state (calibration, profiles, logs); Debian policy requires purge to delete all package state. Without this, `apt purge openastro-phd2` would leave the state dir orphaned on disk. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.

### Changed
- wxConfig moved out of the upstream PHD2 namespace so OpenAstro PHD2 2.0.0 can be installed side-by-side with the official PHD2 without sharing settings or clobbering the other app's data on uninstall. wxApp `VendorName` `StarkLabs` → `OpenAstro`; wxApp `AppName` `PHD2`/`phd2` → `OpenAstroPHD2`/`openastro-phd2`; wxConfig path `PHDGuidingV2` → `OpenAstroPHD2`. Resulting locations: `HKCU\Software\OpenAstro\OpenAstroPHD2` (Windows), `~/.OpenAstroPHD2` (Linux), `~/.OpenAstroPHD2` / per-bundle prefs (macOS). `phd2.iss.in` registry block updated to target the new path so the Inno Setup uninstaller's `uninsdeletekey` no longer touches `HKCU\Software\StarkLabs\PHDGuidingV2` — uninstalling OpenAstro PHD2 used to wipe upstream PHD2's settings, which it no longer does. New `PhdConfig::PhdConfig()` runs a one-shot copy from the legacy `StarkLabs/PHDGuidingV2` store the first time the new store is empty so OpenAstro PHD2 1.3.0 users' profiles, calibration, and per-equipment settings carry forward automatically. The legacy store is read-only during migration; upstream PHD2 keeps its own copy of the settings intact on machines where both apps are present.
- Unified artifact naming across all three platforms: `openastro-phd2-<version>-<arch>.<ext>` for the `.deb`, `.dmg`, and `.exe`. Previously each platform used its own convention (`PHD2-2.0.0-macOS-arm64.dmg`, `phd2-alpaca_2.0.0_amd64.deb`, `PHD2-2.0.0-x64.exe`); now they share a single recognizable prefix. macOS DMG name updated in `build-dmg.sh`. Windows installer name + Inno Setup `APP_NAME`/`DefaultDirName`/`DefaultGroupName`/`OutputBaseFilename` updated in `build-exe.ps1` and `phd2.iss.in`. Linux `.deb` is renamed post-build to convert dpkg's underscores into hyphens (the package internal name is still underscored per dpkg's filename convention).
- Linux package renamed `phd2-alpaca` → `openastro-phd2`. Debian source/binary package name, system user, install paths (`/usr/lib/openastro-phd2`, `/var/lib/openastro-phd2`), systemd unit (`debian/openastro-phd2.service`), and installed wrapper/binary names all match. `Conflicts: phd2-alpaca` + `Replaces: phd2-alpaca` in `debian/control` blocks side-by-side installs and lets dpkg handle the upgrade cleanly. `phd2.sh.in`'s `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` now prefers `lib/openastro-phd2` (where the bundled INDI 2.x dylibs land). Existing `phd2-alpaca` users need a `sudo apt remove phd2-alpaca` before installing the new package — the package name change crosses dpkg's identity boundary, not a transparent upgrade.
- `debian/rules` `override_dh_auto_test` now resolves the cmake build dir deterministically: tries `obj-$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)` first (the canonical path `dh_auto_configure` creates), and only falls back to a **sorted** `obj-*-linux-*` glob if that's missing. Previously used `ls -d obj-*-linux-* | head -1` which would pick an arbitrary directory if cross-build residue from a prior arch was sitting in the tree, silently invalidating the test gate. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.
- README "Building Installers" Windows entry expanded with output filename, bundled-dependency list (vcpkg DLLs: wxWidgets, OpenCV, curl, libINDI, cfitsio), unsigned/SmartScreen caveat, and Inno Setup install path — matching the level of detail the macOS entry already had.

### Fixed
- `test_jsonrpc_schema.cpp` now type-guards every `json_value` union access. Added `ASSERT_EQ(units->type, JSON_STRING)` and `ASSERT_EQ(axes->type, JSON_STRING)` before the `string_value` reads in the `GetLockShiftParams` enabled branch, and upgraded the `expect_string_field` / `expect_numeric_field` / `expect_bool_field` helpers from `EXPECT_EQ` to `ASSERT_EQ` on the type check. Wrong-type accesses now hard-stop the test instead of progressing to UB on a mismatched union member. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.
- `test_jsonrpc_schema::JsonRpcSchema.SettleDoneEvent` now asserts `Error` is absent on success (Status==0) responses, not just on the failure branch. Schema spec says Error exists iff Status≠0; downstream consumers (NINA, KStars) read `Error` as a truthy "did the settle fail" indicator, so a spurious empty-string Error on success would look like a settle failure to them. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.
- `test_jsonrpc_schema::JsonRpcSchema.ResponseEnvelopeSuccess` and `ResponseEnvelopeError` now assert envelope exclusivity (`result` xor `error`). Previously each branch only asserted the required key was present; a mixed envelope with both keys would pass both tests silently. Per JSON-RPC 2.0 the response MUST have exactly one of `result` or `error`. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.
- `test_jsonrpc_schema::JsonRpcSchema.GetLockShiftParams` disabled-branch now asserts `rate`, `units`, and `axes` are absent. Comment said "only enabled is present" but the test didn't enforce it; a server that started emitting `rate`/`units`/`axes` alongside `enabled=false` would pass the test. CodeRabbit feedback on PR #12.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Unit test suite covering the API contracts and pure math the fork ships, wired into `enable_testing()` so `ctest` runs alongside the existing GP tests. New `option(PHD_BUILD_TESTS ON)` defaults the suite ON so `build-deb.sh` (via `dh_auto_test`), `build-dmg.sh`, and `build-exe.ps1` all pick it up automatically — pass `-DPHD_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` to skip. Six new test executables under `tests/`: `test_json_parser` (the deserializer that backs every Alpaca response and event-server inbound RPC); `test_jsonrpc_schema` (contract test for the documented event-server message shapes — `Version`, `AppState`, `SettleDone`, `Settling`, `StarSelected`, JSON-RPC envelope, `get_profiles`, `get_profile`, `get_lock_shift_params` — so a downstream-visible field rename surfaces at PR time instead of via a Discord report); `test_alpaca_schema` (Alpaca standard envelope, `ErrorNumber`/`ErrorMessage` extraction including the float-coerced lenient path, camera/telescope `Value` shapes, the property-name fallback used when servers omit the standard wrapper, the management API `apiversions`/`configureddevices` shapes, the discovery UDP `{"AlpacaPort": N}` reply); `test_discovery_logic` (host:port parse contract and the `std::set<wxString>` dedupe model shared by `AlpacaDiscovery` and `INDIDiscovery`); `test_indi_discovery` (INDI-only subnet enumeration math — prefix clamping `16..30` with `/24` fallback, mask construction, loopback skip, scan-range network/broadcast skip, plus the "always probe `127.0.0.1`" contract from the 1.3.0 loopback fix that lets headless Pi setups discover a same-box INDI server); `test_guide_algorithm_math` (math-twin pinning of `identity`, `hysteresis`, and `resistswitch` `result()` curves, with the production line numbers referenced in test comments so any formula edit forces a deliberate update on both sides). Build infra uses a `tests/include/phd.h` shadow + `-include` force-include to neutralise `src/phd.h`'s wxWidgets transitive pull on test targets that don't need it. New `tests/README.md` documents the per-suite test style (real / fixture-contract / model / math-twin) and the deferred items: Lowpass/Lowpass2/ZFilter (need `WindowedAxisStats` / `ZFilterFactory`), star detection (needs `usImage`), calibration math (needs `Mount` / `Scope`), and end-to-end testing of `CameraAlpaca::Capture()`'s bounded-retry fix from e7a91ddc.
- `/release` slash command that bumps `version.md`, closes `## [Unreleased]` into a numbered version section, gathers commit references via `git log`, and creates the release commit.
- macOS Apple Silicon (arm64) build support. New `run_dmg.sh` and `build-dmg.sh` at the project root mirror the Linux/Windows pattern (`run_deb.sh` + `build-deb.sh`, `run_exe.bat` + `build-exe.ps1`). `build-dmg.sh` produces a fully self-contained `PHD2-<version>-macOS-arm64.dmg`: 15 Homebrew dylibs (cfitsio, wxWidgets 3.3, image libs, pcre2, sharpyuv via @rpath) are recursively copied into `PHD2.app/Contents/Frameworks/` and their install names rewritten with `install_name_tool` so end users don't need Homebrew installed to run the app.
- macOS DMG "drag to /Applications" install window. `build-dmg.sh` now builds a writable scratch DMG, lays out an icon-view Finder window via AppleScript (700×600 logical, 128px icons), drops in an `/Applications` symlink as the drag target, and uses a custom background image at `packaging/macos/background.png` so users see the OpenAstro branding next to the install layout instead of a bare Finder window.
- macOS dark mode support. `Info.plist.in` opts in via `NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance=false` so window chrome, dialogs, menus, and controls follow System Settings → Appearance instead of being forced into the legacy light Aqua theme.
- Alpaca rotator support on macOS (`ROTATOR_ALPACA` enabled in `rotators.h`) and Alpaca guide-output support on macOS (`GUIDE_ALPACA` added to `scopes.h`), matching the fork's "Alpaca + INDI only" philosophy.

### Changed
- All three packaging scripts now hard-fail on a single failing test, with no per-script bypass. `build-exe.ps1` previously emitted a warning and continued past `ctest` failures (silently shipping installers built off red tests); it now `exit 1`s, with the same behaviour if `ctest` itself can't be located. `build-dmg.sh` lost its `--skip-tests` flag entirely. `debian/rules` gained an `override_dh_auto_test` that calls `ctest --output-on-failure` directly on the `obj-*-linux-*` build dir instead of routing through `dh_auto_test`, so `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck` no longer skips the suite. The only kill-switch on every platform is now `cmake -DPHD_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`, which has to be passed deliberately.
- `/commit` slash command now appends an entry to `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` so release notes accumulate per-commit instead of being backfilled at release time.
- macOS minimum deployment target raised `10.14` → `26.0` (Tahoe). Matches the fork's pattern of dropping legacy floors and lets the build delete the now-dead "Sonoma+" conditional code in `run_cmake-osx` / `build/build-mac`. Tahoe also drops the last Intel Macs from Apple's supported list, aligning with the arm64-only target.
- macOS scripts restructured: `build/build-mac` and `run_cmake-osx` removed; `run_dmg.sh` and `build-dmg.sh` at the project root are now the entry points (mirroring `run_deb.sh` + `build-deb.sh`). `MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in` renamed to `Info.plist.in` to match Apple's canonical bundle filename.
- macOS build wiring: `cfitsio` now links against the Homebrew dylib (the previous static `.a`-only constraint matched no Homebrew bottle); `libnova` lookup drops the hardcoded `/usr/local/lib` path (Intel Homebrew) in favor of `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, so the same code path works on `/opt/homebrew` (arm64) and `/usr/local` (Intel); zlib explicitly added to the macOS link line for INDI 2.x's `basedevice.cpp` (`uncompress`); Eigen3 include path now queried from the `Eigen3::Eigen` target so Eigen 5.x (which dropped `EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR`) works.
- "OSX" terminology cleanup in CMake comments / section headers and script names — Apple retired the "OS X" branding in 2016. User-facing wire-protocol identifiers (`PHD_OSNAME`, update-check URL paths) deliberately left unchanged to avoid breaking update notifications for existing installs.
- macOS app bundle rebranded "PHD2" → "OpenAstro PHD2". Bundle name, identifier (`org.openphdguiding.phd2` → `net.openastro.phd2`), icon (`PHD_OSX_icon.icns` → `AppIcon.icns` with new OpenAstro raspberry artwork), and copyright string all updated. `run_phd2_macos` updated to match the new bundle ID when toggling `NSAppSleepDisabled`.
- INDI/Alpaca server discovery moved off the main thread. `INDIConfig::OnDiscover` and `AlpacaConfig::OnDiscover` now run `DiscoverServers()` via `std::async` and pump the UI event loop while waiting, instead of blocking the GUI thread for the 2–4s discovery window. On macOS that block was over the beachball threshold and the dialog visibly froze; the cursor is also forcibly held to the standard pointer each tick so wxOSX/AppKit doesn't swap it for the wait/watch cursor mid-discovery.
- INDI device setup dialogs (`CameraINDI`, `ScopeINDI`, `RotatorINDI`) no longer auto-connect to the configured server when the dialog opens. Auto-connect blocked the main thread for 3–6s waiting for a server that often wasn't running — on macOS surfaced as a beachball that users perceived as a hang. The dialog already has its own Discover Servers and Connect buttons; users now trigger the connection deliberately.
- `README.md` reorganized around a Run / Build Installers / Test structure with the platforms listed Linux → macOS → Windows in each section. The "all three packaging scripts run the full test suite and abort on failure" gate from 94c80630 is now called out explicitly at the top of the Build Installers section instead of buried in a parenthetical, and the lower-priority verbose preamble was trimmed.

- Linux build scripts (`build-deb.sh`, `run_deb.sh`) now target Debian 13 Trixie / Raspberry Pi OS Trixie only, with fail-fast architecture checks rejecting hosts that aren't amd64 or arm64.
- Windows build modernized: C++14 → C++20, and wxWidgets minimum pinned to 3.2 (was unpinned and silently accepted 3.0). `run_win.bat` now configures with `-A x64`.
- C++20 conformance fixes across the source tree: ternary common-type ambiguities resolved in seven files (camera, gear_dialog, image_math, mount, myframe, rotator, guide_algorithm_gaussian_process); `DispatchObj` / `DispatchClass` in `comdispatch.h`/`.cpp` now take `const OLECHAR *` to satisfy `/Zc:strictStrings`; missing `#include "CVTrace.h"` added to `thirdparty/VidCapture/Source/VidCapture/CVImage.h` so the `CVAssert` macro is visible to `/permissive-`'s template-body parsing.
- About dialog refreshed: Joey Troy is the sole Project maintainer; Andy Galasso and Bruce Waddington moved to Past maintainers alongside Craig Stark and Bret McKee; `Copyright 2026 OpenAstro` added to the copyright list.
- Windows build wiring rewired for x64-only: `thirdparty.cmake` replaces the `WINDOWS_ARCH` x86/x64 detection with a hardcoded `x64` plus a configure-time `FATAL_ERROR` if `-A Win32` (or anything else) is passed; the VidCapture compile block, the x86 wxWidgets lib-dir branch, and the x86-only `msvcr120.dll` copy are all gone. `build-installer.ps1` and `build/build-win` updated for x64-only — `build/build-win`'s `-a arch` option removed since there's only one architecture. `phd2-x86.iss.in` renamed to `phd2.iss.in`.
- vcpkg pin bumped `2024.11.16` → `2026.03.18` (18 months of port updates in one shot). Notable bundled-library bumps: cfitsio `3.49` → `4.6.3` (major version), curl `8.18.0` → `8.19.0`, plus refreshed OpenCV 4.x and Eigen3. The 2026.03.18 release also carries a security fix for OpenSSL on Windows (ZDI-CAN-29616).
- libINDI ExternalProject bumped from `v2.1.6` to `v2.2.1.1` (current active 2.2 maintenance line; the 2.1 line dead-ended at v2.1.9). v2.2.1.1 is a same-day hotfix on top of v2.2.1. Verified end-to-end against the INDI-DEV OVA with a Player One camera — server discovery, device connect, and frame capture all clean. This is the line that contains the meaningful Player One driver fixes the 1.3.0 INDI-1.9-removal commit was alluding to.
- GoogleTest FetchContent pin bumped `v1.14.0` → `v1.17.0` (~33 months of test framework updates in one step). Required floor moves to C++17 (we're on C++20, so already covered). All four existing test executables (`GaussianProcessTest`, `MathToolboxTest`, `GPGuiderTest`, `GuidePerformanceTest`) build and run against the new version.

### Removed
- Ubuntu PPA guidance, wxWidgets 3.0 fallback paths, and armhf/i386 build support from the Linux build scripts.
- 32-bit Windows build target. `run_win.bat` now passes `-A x64`.
- `WinLibs/x86/` — 9 32-bit redist DLLs and legacy libraries (`msvcr120.dll` VS2013 runtime, `inpout32.dll` legacy port I/O, `wxVidCapLib_wx29`).
- `thirdparty/VidCapture/` — vendored DirectShow video-capture library (~2003), only compiled on Windows x86 and unreferenced from `src/`.
- `upload.cmd` — legacy buildbot upload script targeting openphdguiding.org's `phd2buildbot` putty session; not used by this fork's release flow.
- `upload.sh` and `build/make-release` — Linux/macOS twins of the already-removed `upload.cmd`. Same `phd2buildbot@openphdguiding.org` SFTP/buildbot infrastructure that this fork doesn't use.
- `APPLE32` branch in `cmake_modules/compiler_options.cmake` (forced i386 architecture; macOS dropped i386 in 10.15) and the QuickTime framework reference in `thirdparty/thirdparty.cmake` (32-bit-only framework removed in macOS 10.15).
- Legacy guide-output drivers on macOS: `GUIDE_GPUSB`, `GUIDE_GCUSBST4`, `GUIDE_EQUINOX`, `GUIDE_EQMAC` defines dropped from `scopes.h`. USB-direct outputs that haven't worked on modern macOS in years and aren't reachable from this fork's Alpaca + INDI guide-output story.
- `IOMainPort` / `IOMasterPort` compatibility shim in `serialport_mac.cpp`. `IOMainPort` was introduced in macOS 12 Monterey; the fork's minimum is now 26 Tahoe.
- `build/build.cfg.sample` — orphaned template referencing the long-removed `build/build-{linux,win,mac}` driver scripts.
- `thirdparty/include/libdc1394-2.2.2/config.h` — autoconf-generated header for the vendored libdc1394 build; unreachable since vendored libdc1394 was retired.
- Intel Mac support. The macOS build is now arm64-only — there is no universal binary, no Rosetta path. Intel users on this fork's Mac path are no longer supported.
- libusb dependency and the vendored `openssag` StarShoot AutoGuider driver. Neither is reachable from `src/` after the 1.2.0 native-camera-SDK cleanup; this fork's cameras come over Alpaca / INDI / ASCOM, none of which need direct USB. Drops `libusb-1.0-0-dev` and `libudev-dev` from Debian build deps, drops `USE_SYSTEM_LIBUSB` from CMake options and `run_deb.sh`, drops the macOS `libusb_openphd.dylib` framework-copy step, and removes 27 vendored files (`libusb-1.0.21.tar.bz2`, `thirdparty/include/libusb-1.0.21/`, entire `thirdparty/openssag/` tree) plus ~140 lines of CMake wiring.

### Fixed
- Dialogs and tool windows opened in random places (often the primary display) instead of next to the main PHD2 window — frustrating on multi-monitor setups. Every `wxDialog` / `wxFrame` subclass in `src/` now centers on its parent: About, Advanced/Preferences, Manual Guide, Calibration Assistant, Build Dark Library, Refine Bad-pixel Map, Connect Equipment, profile wizard + its `ConnectDialog` sub-dialog, `INDIConfig`, `AlpacaConfig`, `IndiGui`, calibration-assistant inner dialogs (Custom / Sanity / Explanation), slit-properties dialog, backlash graph, calstep dialog, calreview dialog, camera-cal import dialog, confirm dialog, manual cal dialog, star-cross test dialog, Gaussian-process expert dialog, log uploader, auto-updater, pier-flip cal tool, scope-pointing dialog, new-profile dialog. `MyFrame::PlaceWindowOnScreen()` (the helper that restores cached tool-window positions) also falls back to `CentreOnParent()` instead of primary-display center when the saved coords are off-screen.
- Profile wizard's Camera and Mount selectors fell through to whatever sorted first alphabetically (Alpaca) when no choice had been made, making the wizard look pre-selected and forcing users to click Alpaca a second time to actually open the configure flow. Both now default to `None`, matching the AuxMount / AO / Rotator / Switch defaults.
- INDI Options dialog (`IndiGui`) wedged the app when closed via the window's X button while running modal — `Show(false)` hid the dialog without ending the modal loop, leaving the app in a state where every click beeped because an invisible modal dialog was "active." Now always `EndModal(wxID_CANCEL)` in the modal case.
- INDI server discovery missed servers bound only to loopback. `INDIDiscovery::DiscoverServers()` now always probes `127.0.0.1:7624` as a unicast target. `EnumerateLocalSubnets()` skips the loopback interface by design (IFF_LOOPBACK on Linux/macOS, 127.0.0.0/8 check on Windows), so when PHD2 and the INDI server both run on the same Linux box — the typical Raspberry Pi setup — the local server was invisible to the Discover Servers button. Same shape of bug as the 1.3.0 `AlpacaDiscovery::BuildBroadcastTargets()` loopback fix.
- Stale `https://github.com/open-astro/phd2-alpaca` Homepage URLs in `debian/control` and `debian/phd2-alpaca.service` corrected to `https://github.com/open-astro/phd2-alpaca-indi` so apt's package metadata and the systemd unit's Documentation field point at the right repo.
- Visual Leak Detector link-directories path in `CMakeLists.txt` updated from `lib/win32` to `lib/Win64` so VLD actually links when present on an x64 build.
- Debian builds against the new INDI 2.2.1.1 failed at configure with `Could NOT find GSL`. INDI 2.2 introduced `INDI_BUILD_COMMON` (defaults `ON`) which pulls driver-development deps (GSL, USB1, JPEG, Nova, Iconv) that this fork's client-only build doesn't need. Pass `-DINDI_BUILD_COMMON=OFF` in the INDI `ExternalProject_Add` so the dep block is skipped.
- Stale "INDI 2.1.6" references in `build-deb.sh`, `run_deb.sh`, `debian/rules`, and `README.md` updated to "INDI 2.2.1.1" to match the actual pinned source build.
- `build-deb.sh` install instructions and `install_deps` apt-get command still listed `libusb-1.0-0-dev` and `libudev-dev` after those were removed from `debian/control`. Now match the actual build requirements.
- `debian/rules` no longer passes the obsolete `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBUSB=1` to `dh_auto_configure`; the option was removed from the CMake project alongside libusb itself.
- x64 architecture guard in `thirdparty/thirdparty.cmake` now also checks `CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` in addition to `CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`, so 32-bit toolchains can't slip through when using Ninja or Unix Makefiles (where `CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM` is empty).
- Fenced code blocks in `.claude/commands/release.md` now carry language tags (`text` / `markdown`) to satisfy markdownlint MD040.
- Alpaca camera hung PHD2 when Stop was pressed during Looping against servers that ack `AbortExposure` but never flip `imageready` to true (e.g. ASCOM Remote Server forwarding a `StopExposure`-only driver). `CameraAlpaca::Capture()` now sends the abort exactly once per exposure and caps the post-abort wait at 3 s before bailing out, instead of hammering the server every poll iteration until the user force-quits. Fixes #7.
- `GPTest.drawSamples_prior_covariance_test` was flaky — the test draws 20 000 samples and compares empirical to analytical covariance within a 2e-1 tolerance, but Eigen's `setRandom()` (used by `math_tools::generate_normal_random_matrix`) reads from `std::rand()`, so run-to-run variation occasionally pushed the empirical covariance outside the band. The `GPTest` fixture constructor now seeds `std::srand(1)`, making every statistical-expectation test in the fixture reproducible across runs. Test-only change. Fixes #8.
- `GPTest.drawSamples_prior_covariance_test` then failed deterministically on the Debian build (passed on Windows/macOS) after the srand seed went in. `std::rand()`'s sequence is platform-specific (glibc vs MSVCRT vs BSD libc), so seed 1 yields a different Monte Carlo realization on each platform; with N=20000 samples the empirical-covariance SE is ~0.15 and the 2e-1 tolerance was only ~1.35σ wide, which glibc's draw happened to land just outside (15.004 vs 14.778, diff 0.226). Loosened the tolerance to 5e-1 (~3.4σ) so the test stays meaningful while tolerating cross-platform `std::rand()` differences under the fixed seed. Test-only change.
- `build-exe.ps1` failed to parse on Windows PowerShell 5.1 after the test-gate commit (94c80630). Two em-dashes (U+2014) were added to a comment and a `Write-Error` string; PS 5.1 reads UTF-8-without-BOM `.ps1` files as CP1252, where the em-dash's UTF-8 bytes (`E2 80 94`) decode to a trailing right-curly-quote that the parser treats as a premature string terminator, producing misleading "missing closing '}'" errors pointing at unrelated lines downstream. Replaced both em-dashes with ASCII hyphens. PowerShell 7+ wouldn't have hit this because it defaults to UTF-8.
- `build-exe.ps1` aborted with `CTest not found at 'ctest.exe'` even when `ctest` was on `PATH`. `Get-Command ctest` returns a `CommandInfo` object whose default string form is just the command's `.Name`; the script then called `Test-Path` on that, which looked for a literal `ctest.exe` in the current directory. Now extracts `.Source` when `Get-Command` succeeds so `Test-Path` and the invocation see the resolved full path.
- `build-exe.ps1` packaging step aborted with `Source file ... msvcr120.dll does not exist`. `phd2.iss.in` still listed `msvcr120.dll` — the **Visual C++ 2013** C runtime — but the fork builds with VS 2022, which produces the VC 14.x runtime (`vcruntime140.dll` / `msvcp140.dll`) instead. Removed the dead entry and added a comment noting the absence is intentional so a future maintainer doesn't add it back.
- Test binaries on Windows failed to compile with `Cannot open include file: 'phd_version.h'`. `tests/CMakeLists.txt` set `target_compile_options(... -include <shadow phd.h>)`, which is GCC/Clang force-include syntax; MSVC silently emits warning D9002 and ignores it, so the shadow header was never active and the real `src/phd.h` won normal lookup (and pulled in `phd_version.h`, generated only into the main build target's include path). Branched on `MSVC` to emit `/FI<file>` instead, which is MSVC's force-include flag.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **Alpaca discovery misses loopback-bound servers**
  - `AlpacaDiscovery::BuildBroadcastTargets()` now always probes `127.0.0.1:32227` as a unicast target so Alpaca servers bound only to loopback (e.g. ASCOM Remote Server's default "Loopback" IP setting) are discovered. Previously these were invisible because subnet broadcasts (255.255.255.255 and per-interface broadcasts) never reach loopback-only listeners — the workaround was to manually edit Remote Server to bind to the LAN IP.
  - Added Linux/macOS network-interface enumeration via `getifaddrs`. Previously the non-Windows path sent only to `255.255.255.255`, so multi-NIC Linux/Pi setups (VPN, docker, multiple LANs) missed servers on subnets the default route did not cover. Mirrors the Windows `GetAdaptersAddresses` path and the pattern in `indi_discovery.cpp`.

### Removed
- **`PHD2_ALLOW_INDI_1_9` escape hatch dropped**
  - INDI 2.0+ is now a hard requirement. Removed the option from `thirdparty/thirdparty.cmake`, the env-var plumbing in `run_deb.sh` / `build-deb.sh`, and the `PHD2_ALLOW_INDI_1_9` make variable in `debian/rules`. The Player One driver and several other INDI drivers have meaningful fixes after 1.9.x; keeping the toggle invited subtly broken builds.
  - For Debian/Pi systems that only ship INDI 1.9.x, `run_deb.sh` now auto-detects this and falls back to building INDI 2.1.6 from source — no manual PPA setup required.

### Changed
- **Auto-detect libindi version in all build paths**
  - `run_deb.sh`, `debian/rules`, and `build-deb.sh` now all probe `pkg-config --atleast-version=2.0.0 libindi`. When the system libindi is missing or < 2.0.0, the build sets `USE_SYSTEM_LIBINDI=0` so CMake fetches and builds INDI 2.1.6 from source as a static client library (no shared libs to bundle). The from-source path was already wired into `thirdparty/thirdparty.cmake`; it just wasn't reachable from any of the user-facing scripts. Override with `USE_SYSTEM_LIBINDI=0` or `=1` explicitly.
  - `build-deb.sh` no longer hard-fails on stale libindi-dev: it now prints which path will be taken (system or from-source) and proceeds. Older libindi-dev on Debian trixie / Pi OS no longer blocks `.deb` builds.
- **Alpaca port default is now `0` (unconfigured) instead of `6800`**
  - `pConfig->Profile.GetLong("/alpaca/port", ...)` now defaults to `0` in `cam_alpaca.cpp`, `scope_alpaca.cpp`, `rotator_alpaca.cpp`, `camera.cpp`, `scope.cpp`, `rotator.cpp`, and `event_server.cpp`. The previous `6800` was AlpacaBridge-specific and misleading for users running ASCOM Remote Server (default `11111`) or anything else.
  - `Connect()` "not yet configured" sentinel in the Alpaca camera/mount/rotator drivers simplified from `host == "localhost" && port == 6800 && device == 0` to just `port == 0`. The old triple-check could spuriously re-open the setup dialog for users genuinely running AlpacaBridge at `localhost:6800` with device 0.
  - `AlpacaConfig::SetSettings()` renders an unconfigured port as an empty field instead of literal `"0"`. The dialog's existing auto-discover path fires when the server list is empty, so new profiles open with empty fields and discovery immediately populates them — matching NINA's flow.

### Added
- **INDI support restored on all platforms**
  - Re-added INDI camera, mount, and rotator drivers (`cam_indi`, `scope_indi`, `rotator_indi`, `config_indi`, `indi_gui`). Available on Windows (via vcpkg-built `indiclient.lib`), macOS, and Linux. AO/stepguider INDI drivers remain removed.
  - Restored `USE_SYSTEM_LIBINDI=1` for Debian builds; INDI 2.x runtime libs bundled into `/usr/lib/phd2-alpaca`.
  - Added `libindi-dev` build dependency to `debian/control`.
- **INDI server discovery**
  - New `INDIDiscovery` class performs parallel non-blocking TCP probes on port 7624 across local /24 subnets. Total scan ~2s.
  - Added Discover Servers button, status label, and discovered-servers combobox to `INDIConfig` dialog. Auto-fires on dialog open when host is empty; picking from the list auto-fills host/port.
- **OpenAstro favicon for the embedded web portal.**
- **Developer tooling**
  - Added `.claude/commands/commit.md` slash command that runs the project's clang-format pass before staging and writes a structured commit message.

### Changed
- **Windows build**
  - Bumped pinned vcpkg to release tag `2024.11.16` (SHA-pinned). Parallelized the Windows build invocation in `run_win.bat` (renamed from `run_cmake.bat`) so multi-core machines actually use their cores. Added flags: `-rebuild`, `-config`, `-launch`. Added Linux counterpart `run_deb.sh`.
  - Enforced CRLF for `.bat` files via `.gitattributes` to keep the Windows build script intact across platforms.
- **Wrapper script and systemd service**
  - Restored `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/phd2-alpaca` in `debian/phd2-alpaca.service` and `phd2.sh.in` so bundled INDI 2.x libs are discoverable at runtime.

### Fixed
- **INDI camera first-exposure disconnect**
  - `CameraINDI::CheckState()` now requires `CCD_INFO` before marking the camera ready, so `Connect()` blocks until `m_maxSize` is populated. Previously the first `Capture()` could send `FRAME` with width=0/height=0, causing the driver to disconnect mid-exposure.
- **Wizard pixel-size auto-fill for INDI cameras**
  - `CameraINDI::GetDevicePixelSize()` now waits briefly for `CCD_INFO` arrival when called immediately after connect, so the profile wizard auto-populates the pixel-size field from the camera (matching Alpaca behavior).
- **Aux-mount cleanup**
  - Collapsed `ScopeINDI`'s aux-mount conditional branches; the gear dialog no longer exposes `AuxScope()` post-slim, so the dead branch is gone.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Removed
- **Legacy camera drivers and SDKs**
  - Removed all non-Alpaca camera drivers and bundled third-party SDK libraries (ZWO, QHY, SBIG, Altair, ToupTek, SVBony, PlayerOne, Moravian, INDI, ASCOM, OpenCV, and remaining legacy backends).
  - Removed associated sources, headers, and SDK references from `CMakeLists.txt` and the `cameras/` tree.
- **Adaptive optics**
  - Removed adaptive optics from the gear dialog, profile wizard, and event server API (StepGuider/SXAO, `stepguider_sbigao_indi`). Stubs retained for backward compatibility.
- **Auxiliary mount and on-camera ST4 guiding**
  - Removed auxiliary mount support and on-camera ST4 guiding (`OnboardST4`, `ScopeOnCamera`, `ScopeOnStepGuider`). Guiding in this fork uses Alpaca only.
- **INDI**
  - Removed INDI support entirely (`scope_indi`, `rotator_indi`, `indi_gui`, `config_indi`).
- **Platform build wiring**
  - Removed macOS framework copy and `install_name_tool` handling for dropped SDKs.
  - Removed `/DELAYLOAD:sbigudrv.dll` from Windows link flags.

### Changed
- **Gear and UI**
  - Simplified gear dialog to camera, mount, and rotator only.
- **Formatting**
  - Applied clang-format across affected files (`event_server.cpp`, `gear_dialog.cpp`, `gear_simulator.cpp`, `profile_wizard.cpp`, `stepguiders.h`, `camera.cpp`).
